A small shop in the New York area, Potential Synergy has recognized how the absence of advanced technology has walled off corners of various industries and prevented other industries from working in unison.

!!! The VR we develop is programmable. Virtual experiences can be manipulated through inputs such as code, player interfacing, or physiological behaviors. Content produced can range from photo-real capture to entirely fictitious dreamscapes.

"Networking" the software allows multiple people to interact in VR together. Some of its immediate results are market creation, distributed file keeping, and remote access to devices.

There are a variety of production techniques, tools, and frameworks used to make XR. They are all synchronized in a software framework called a "game engine". A game engine is used to create interactive 3D media (XR). These engines are powerful visualization tools for developing all the features of the internet (networked play, social sharing, secure payments, etc.) into a single application.

Game engines empower developers to custom-design virtual environments. The core game engine frameworks include rendering 3D graphics, engineering physics engines (and response systems), managing memory, and handling graphics scenes.

Nova economizes the Virtual Reality (VR) development process by adapting game engine builds (software executable) to create new VR experiences. By developing with foresight, producers save time and money.

## Game Engines you may have heard of are:

- Unity
- Unreal
- Cryengine
- GameMaker Studio
- Godot
- OpenGL
- Blender
- Source
- Doom Engine
- Havok
- Panda3D
- ORGE

## Please replace current "Develop" intro text with...

They all include advantages and disadvantages (varying features, code, graphical interfaces, etc.). The best way to determine your favorite game engine is by understanding what you want to accomplish and why.`;
