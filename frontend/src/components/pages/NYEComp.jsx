Business is conducted among people. We love building relationships with folks from all over the world. It's who we are. In the process we've discovered this mentality is the same one that builds strong partnerships. Nova is a place of business because we value the individual, understanding that the financial elements of business emerge from a genuine interest in thy neighbor.`;

Our studio and laboratory are located at the edge of Red Hook. When Van Brunt Street meets the Upper Bay, under Liberty's watch. This part of South Brooklyn has a rich history of hard work, innovation, and the American Dream. Our building is Civil War-era, built by Robinson and Beard in the 1860s and 70s. Now it is home to a variety of artists and tradesmen that fuel the innovation Brooklyn is known for.

Virtual Reality brings us to a place where the confines of the physical world can disappear. Time and gravity and our relationship with space have been as much a part of the human experience as our need for air. Now, in these virtual worlds, we’re breaking free from these physical measurements.

!!! We're reminded of our quest for this new idea of freedom every time we look out the window of our Nova Studios and see the Statue of Liberty.

100 years after the United States formed its own union, the French designed and built the Statue of Liberty to honor this new version of freedom. It's emergence was followed by one of the greatest periods of human migration, as nearly 20 million people immigrated through the New York Harbor in search of freedom from religious persecution, economic disparity, and tyrannical leadership - elements of their human experience that had shackled them in their home nations.

As these immigrants arrived to the New York Harbor fresh off a weeks-long journey across the Atlantic, they saw her, 151 feet tall, holding up a beacon of light and with a set of shackles laying broken at her feet.

More than a century later, Nova XR's studios sit right here in union with her - Extending Reality along a quest to reach this next world of media.

Two of our co founders trace their lineage back to folks who emigrated across the Atlantic toward the end of the 19th century, while two others come from Paris, the city in which La Liberté éclairant le monde was conceived.

Together we're a small part of the 21st century movement into Extended Reality, and we're inviting others to come along.`;
