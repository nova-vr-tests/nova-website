const consultationIntro = `# Introduction

!!! Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), fitting under the parent term "Extended Reality", enhance communication, collaboration, and education. Unlike it's predecessors, XR Media is interactive, calling on the user to embody her consciousness.

These technologies will increasingly be in the home, integrating with daily living in the way televisions, computers, and phones already have. As of today, you can engage with simulated environments through your phone (or XR glasses/goggles).

Historical rates of technological adoption suggest 25% of the US population will have an AR/VR in their homes within the next five years. It's the next frontier of human connectivity.

In business, XR Media cuts internal costs by providing immersive training programs and business travel alternatives. When used to drive revenue, XR is a natural marketing tool, the backdrop for new age content creation.

XR Media can be the ultimate communication tool or the reason your business falls behind.`;

const developIntro = `# Introduction

!!! The VR we develop is programmable. Virtual experiences can be manipulated through inputs such as code, player interfacing, or physiological behaviors. Content produced can range from photo-real capture to entirely fictitious dreamscapes.

"Networking" the software allows multiple people to interact in VR together. Some of its immediate results are market creation, distributed file keeping, and remote access to devices.

There are a variety of production techniques, tools, and frameworks used to make XR. They are all synchronized in a software framework called a "game engine". A game engine is used to create interactive 3D media (XR). These engines are powerful visualization tools for developing all the features of the internet (networked play, social sharing, secure payments, etc.) into a single application.

Game engines empower developers to custom-design virtual environments. The core game engine frameworks include rendering 3D graphics, engineering physics engines (and response systems), managing memory, and handling graphics scenes.

Nova economizes the Virtual Reality (VR) development process by adapting game engine builds (software executable) to create new VR experiences. By developing with foresight, producers save time and money.

## Game Engines you may have heard of are:

- Unity
- Unreal
- Cryengine
- GameMaker Studio
- Godot
- OpenGL
- Blender
- Source
- Doom Engine
- Havok
- Panda3D
- ORGE

## Please replace current "Develop" intro text with...

They all include advantages and disadvantages (varying features, code, graphical interfaces, etc.). The best way to determine your favorite game engine is by understanding what you want to accomplish and why.`;

Business is conducted among people. We love building relationships with folks from all over the world. It's who we are. In the process we've discovered this mentality is the same one that builds strong partnerships. Nova is a place of business because we value the individual, understanding that the financial elements of business emerge from a genuine interest in thy neighbor.`;

const findUs = `Our studio and laboratory are located at the edge of Red Hook. When Van Brunt Street meets the Upper Bay, under Liberty's watch. This part of South Brooklyn has a rich history of hard work, innovation, and the American Dream. Our building is Civil War-era, built by Robinson and Beard in the 1860s and 70s. Now it is home to a variety of artists and tradesmen that fuel the innovation Brooklyn is known for.

const whoWeAreIntro = `# Introduction

Virtual Reality brings us to a place where the confines of the physical world can disappear. Time and gravity and our relationship with space have been as much a part of the human experience as our need for air. Now, in these virtual worlds, we’re breaking free from these physical measurements.

!!! We're reminded of our quest for this new idea of freedom every time we look out the window of our Nova Studios and see the Statue of Liberty.

100 years after the United States formed its own union, the French designed and built the Statue of Liberty to honor this new version of freedom. It's emergence was followed by one of the greatest periods of human migration, as nearly 20 million people immigrated through the New York Harbor in search of freedom from religious persecution, economic disparity, and tyrannical leadership - elements of their human experience that had shackled them in their home nations.

As these immigrants arrived to the New York Harbor fresh off a weeks-long journey across the Atlantic, they saw her, 151 feet tall, holding up a beacon of light and with a set of shackles laying broken at her feet.

More than a century later, Nova XR's studios sit right here in union with her - Extending Reality along a quest to reach this next world of media.

Two of our co founders trace their lineage back to folks who emigrated across the Atlantic toward the end of the 19th century, while two others come from Paris, the city in which La Liberté éclairant le monde was conceived.

Together we're a small part of the 21st century movement into Extended Reality, and we're inviting others to come along.`;

const aboutUs = `# Nova
